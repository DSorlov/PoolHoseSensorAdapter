# Pool hose sensor adapter

I have a pool with 38mm flexible hoses but I wanted to mount ph, particle and temperature sensors on my hoses. Trying to mount the sensors was challenging due to the fact you will need something that will not leak. So what I decided was to go with a sensor adapter that had a flat surface so I could easily mount water tight cable glands while still able to put the sensors inside the pool hose (and not as a tangled mess in the skimmer).
