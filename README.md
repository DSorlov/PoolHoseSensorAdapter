# Pool hose sensor adapter

I have a pool and I wanted to get some data from my pool water such as its temperature, ph and the number of particles in the water. The pool I got have a skimmer and a inlet valve, connected with 38mm flexible hoses. The hoses are round (duh!) and so it is hard to screw something into them without creating a leak. The connections should also be somewhat robust so they wont break and I can trust them to be unattended.

So what I decided was to go with a sensor adapter that I could splice in between two joints in the existing hose and clamp down using standard hose clamps. I would need a flat surface where I could easily mount standard water tight cable glands to allow the sensors to be inside the flow of water while still maintaining easy maintinence (change the sensors etc) and keeping it water tight. The top surface of the adapter allows me to drill holes depending the size of the cable gland and the sensor.

I have printed it in PETG and it seems to withstand the chemicals and sunlight after a year of usage. I have printed the models using 100% infill to make sure it is stable and that I can drill holes without comprimising it. Feel free to edit the model and please share any usage you have!
